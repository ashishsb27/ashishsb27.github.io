/* Overriding breakpoint to fix the visibility of the menu button (visible only on SM size and smaller). Couldn't figure out any other way to show menu button only on XS size while keeping the menu items hidden on MD+ sizes at the same time. The new Bootstrap doesn't have any 'visible-xs' classes and have only 'display' classes which I can't impliment properly (or I'm just stupid :D)*/
